# myopenstories
Designed to encourage the sharing of interactive stories created by the community for the community, the website formerly named www.mhios.com is an open repository for stories in the STUdio format, a set of tools to read and create interactive stories with possibility to transfer from and to the lunii story teller device.

This website is now offline. This repository contains the Django/js/html... sources required to run the server.
